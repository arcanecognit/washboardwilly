        <h3>Izzy Bracelets and Kensley Necklaces</h3>
        <div style="width: 300px">   
        <p>The children's line of jewelry I make is my favorite work. The Kensley necklaces and the Izzy bracelets are named for and inspired by my neices. I took advantage of my platform to help instill what I feel is a very valuable lesson for young people in today's world. With every purchase you will receive a note saying
"If you look closely at this piece, you may notice something is different about it. It may have a piece that is a different color than the rest. It may have a piece that is out of order. It may have a piece facing in a different direction. I did that on purpose. I believe that what makes things beautiful isn't being perfect, but being unique. I believe that the things that make us not exactly like everybody else are what make us beautiful. When you wear this, let it serve as a reminder that what makes you beautiful is what makes you different. I made this piece to be exactly like you, beautiful because it truly is one of a kind."</p>
