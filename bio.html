        <h3>How it Started</h3>
        <p>So here's a little background into how Washboard Willie's became a thing. 
            It all started when my nephew kept breaking all of my wonderful wife's (Washboard Mellie's)
             jewelry. He was just being a strong curious baby. I recon she thought since I could fix a 
             washing machine, I could fix a necklace. I noticed that her jewelry wasn't exactly made to 
             hold up to very much, so I grabbed some 8x braided 125lb test fishing line and gave it a try.
              Turns out not only did I enjoy it, I was pretty good at it too. Well her mom liked it, 
              then a co- worker liked it snd a few years later I have become a business. I use only natural
               stones. You won't see any plastic on this stuff. I also make every single piece one of a kind,
                with the exclusion of the pieces I donate to charities. If you can imagine something, there's
                 a good chance I can make it a reality. Send me a message and we'll make it happen.</p>
